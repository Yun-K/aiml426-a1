I am using the python for this assignment, so program.zip and source.zip are actually the same.

I use jupyter notebook for all parts, so you can clearly observe the results by opening the jupyter notebook. 
For part 1, the p1.ipynb can be found via `p1/p1.ipynb`, which is under the `p1` directory. 

For part 2, the p2.ipynb can be found via `p2/p2.ipynb`, which is under the `p2` directory. 

For part 3, the p3.ipynb can be found via `p3/p3.ipynb`, which is under the `p3` directory. 



In addition, I have also transformed all *.ipynb to *.py files as well, so you can run my programms using the command line as well. 
Below are the steps and commands to run my programs:

First, u need to unzip the program.zip and `cd` to the program directory, 
    such as: > cd program

then, rest of this readme.txt contains commands to run the *.py for each part, you can just copy and paste in the terminal.

`Also, it is worth to mention that it is time consuming to run via commands, I suggest you to just look at the *.ipynb since it is intuitive.`

Part 1: 
    > cd p1 && python p1.py && cd ..

Part 2: 
    > cd p2 && python p2.py && cd ..

Part 3: 
    > cd p3 && python p3.py && cd ..

Part 4: 
    > cd p4 && python p4.py && cd ..

Part 5: 
    > cd p5 && python p5.py && cd ..
